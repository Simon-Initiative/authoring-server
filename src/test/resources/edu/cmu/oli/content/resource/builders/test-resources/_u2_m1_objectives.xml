    <title>Couples</title>
    <objective id="recognize_forces_rotation" category="domain_specific">Recognize that at least two forces are necessary to cause only a
        rotation of a body, and utilize the concept of a couple and its symbol to
        represent combinations of forces that produce zero net force (only a tendency to
        rotate). </objective>
    <objective id="determine_moment_couple" category="domain_specific">Determine the moment of the couple from the forces producing it or
        balancing it, and recognize that a set of forces that can be represented as couples
        produces the same net moment about all points regardless of
        where they are applied. </objective>
    <objective id="recognize_multi-force_interaction" category="domain_specific">Recognize circumstances in which a multi-force interaction between
        two bodies can be represented as a couple, and determine the moment of the couple
        from what the couple interaction is balancing. </objective>
