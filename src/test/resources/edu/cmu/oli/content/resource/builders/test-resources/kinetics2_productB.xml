			<title>The Rate of Product Formation.</title>
			<body>
				<p>In the last section, the action of an enzyme was described as taking place in two
					parts. The first part involves the binding of substrate to enzyme in a
					reversible equilibrium as modeled in the way of ligand binding. The second part
					involves the conversion of the [ES] complex to product and the release of the
					product from the enzyme. This step represents the catalysis step in the enzyme
					catalyzed reaction. These parts are illustrated in the overall reaction below:</p>
				<p>
					<formula>E + S &lt;=&gt; [ES] -&gt; P + E </formula>
				</p>
				<p>The rate, or velocity (v), of the reaction is usually determined by measuring the
					amount of product (P) produced/unit time:</p>
				<p>
					<formula>v=dP/dt</formula>
				</p>
				<p>The dependence of the reaction velocity on the kinetics of substrate binding,
					substrate release, and conversion to product is difficult to calculate under all
					conditions. However, if <em>steady-state</em> conditions are assumed then a very
					simple relationship can be found. Steady-state conditions imply that during the
					measurement the concentrations of the various species, e.g. [ES] ,do not change.
					Under steady-state conditions the following equation describes the relationship
					between the measured rate (v) of the reaction and the initial concentration of substrate
					(S) and the concentration of the enzyme. This equation is the Michaelis
					Menton-Briggs Haldane equation.</p>

				<p> In this equation, k<sub>cat</sub> is the rate at which the [ES] complex decays
					to product. V<sub>max</sub> is k<sub>cat</sub> multiplied by the <em>total</em>
					amount of enzyme, E<sub>t</sub>. It is therefore the maximum velocity at which
					the reaction can occur under a fixed enzyme concentration. K<sub>m</sub> is also
					a constant that reflects the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate and is an
					approximation of the dissociation equilibrium constant. Both k<sub>cat</sub> and
						K<sub>m</sub> depend on the particular enzyme and substrate.</p>
				<!--<p>
					<em>Based on your understanding of dissociation and the concept of equilibrium,
						would you expect a high affinity of enzyme for substrate to be reflected by
						a high or low K<sub>m</sub> value? </em>
				</p>-->
				<p> This equation can also be represented graphically by the hyperbolic curve
					illustrated below. This curve can be dissected into two parts: a region at the
					beginning where the velocity of the reaction increases proportionately with the
					amount of substrate present initially in the reaction, and the later region of
					the curve, at high substrate concentration, where the rate of the reaction is
					independent of the substrate concentration. This latter region defines
					saturation of the enzyme by substrate and the velocity approaches the value of
						V<sub>max</sub>.</p>

				<!--<p>
					<em> If the K<sub>M</sub> were equal to the substrate concentration, what would
					the velocity of the enzyme catalyzed reaction be?</em> [Hint: substitute
					K<sub>m</sub> for [S] in the above equation.] </p>
					<p>
					<em>Over what substrate concentration (region of the curve) would you expect a
					cell to operate in order to have control over the rate (velocity) of an
					enzyme in the cell?</em>

				<p>Enzyme catalysis is affected by many factors including substrate and
					enzyme concentrations, pH, temperature, and the presence of inhibitors.
					The learn-by-doing on this page will explore the effect of substrate
					concentration.  The following page will explore the effect of enzyme
					concentration, pH, temperature, and inhibitors on the velocity of the
					enzyme catalyzed reaction.
