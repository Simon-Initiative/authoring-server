			<p>Use the activities below to help develop a plan for how you will work through this unit.
				For each learning objective, first evaluate your abilities in the <em>Assess
					Yourself</em> part and then complete the <em>Test Your Performance</em> part to get
				a measure of your actual abilities.  Based on these results, develop a quick <em>Plan</em> for how to approach this learning ojective.</p>
			<p>Once you've done this for all of the learning objectives, complete the <em>Reflect and
				Plan</em> activity. In this last part, you'll compare your actual performance
				against your self-assessment, reassess your abilities if necessary and formulate a
				strategy for how best to approach the rest of the unit.</p>

				<hint>Did you find that you did well on the performance assessment? If so, you may
					not need to work through all the material in this unit. But to be on the safe
					side, try answering a few questions in each section to further assess your
					capabilities. If you find you do well, skip to the unit review quiz and see how
