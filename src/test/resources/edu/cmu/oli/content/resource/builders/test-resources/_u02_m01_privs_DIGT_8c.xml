            <p> More test assd As soon as he got onto the campus network, Kurt began scanning for shared files,
                hoping to find free music and movies. In the process of looking for media, he found
                that he also had access to some students’ personal files—health histories, journals,
                even some pictures. Since the information wasn’t protected, Kurt felt free to enjoy
                the free movies, songs and applications, and started snooping on other students’
                information. Kurt didn’t stop at accessing the files himself; he also began to share
                many of the files with his friends, and to talk about some of the pictures he viewed
                with a number of his close friends. </p>

            <body>
                <p>Consider this scenario and reflect on the Computing Policy. Does anyone involved
                    besides Kurt have relevant responsibilities? What do you consider appropriate
                    consequences for Kurt? Compare your answer to that of an expert.</p>

                <response input="reflect" score="1"/>
                <explanation><p>In the scenario above, it’s clear that the bulk of the policy violations are on Kurt’s
                        shoulders—his behavior is particularly disrespectful and is an inappropriate
                        use of shared community resources. Although he was finding media and
                        personal files that were not protected against viewing from other community
                        members, it’s clear that his continued access violates the privacy and
                        property rights of other individuals or groups, some as outside copyright
                        holders (in the case of the media and applications) and others as members of
                        the Carnegie Mellon community. However, it’s also worth noting that other
                        users appear to have not taken their own responsibilities seriously
                        enough—protecting their own account security and confidentiality (and
                        respecting the property rights of copyright owners) means they should be
                        taking appropriate action to protect shared files, whether by password
                        protecting them or turning off file sharing all together. At a minimum, Kurt
                        could probably face a network suspension if complaints are made or network
                        detection of his unauthorized scanning continues. Beyond the Computing
                        Policy, it also seems likely that Kurt will face a more formal disciplinary
                        process through Student Affairs.</p>
